The original list of C.K. Ogden clearly follows the principle of 'minimal representation',
namely: the names of things are included in the list if it would take many words,
sometimes several sentences to explain 'what it is' that you are referring to.

This principle is no doubt extremely important and valid constraint, but it's not
the only one as I noticed while reading the lists. Probably a more important concept
that he managed to grasp is what I would call 'multidimensionality'. You can literally
see how many of these words mean something in particular in multiple contexts.

In particular:
a.) Literally speaking;
b.) Figuratively speaking...
